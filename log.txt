Collision interface is not sufficient
Floor integrated into Terrain
Object completely removed
makefile reflects changes

3/26/2013
Finished updating Vector
Delaying work on Agent until UI is mapped out
Removed references to Agent
Began integrating Floor into Terrain

3/25/2013
Began updating Vector
Did review

3/4/2013
God:
Removed sHead and selectable pointers
-design conflicted with Object implementation
Added attemptSelect()

Camera:
Removed Object interface
-interface not used by class

Object:
Added virtual bool collide(const Vector&) const=0
Added virtual bool collide(const Object&) const=0
-Most things with the Object interface have a collision
 status. This forces entities that use the interface to
 implement collision testing.

Terrain:
Added virtual bool collide(const Vector&) const
Added virtual bool collide(const Object&) const

Floor:
Added virtual bool collide(const Vector&) const
Added virtual bool collide(const Object&) const

Agent:
Added virtual bool collide(const Vector&) const
Added virtual bool collide(const Object&) const
2/27/2013
Object:
Removed functions that no longer suited interface
-removed pure virtual move
-removed virtual draw
-draw readded, removal broke scene rendering

Camera:
Makes relative moves using wasd
Does rotate using qe
Up/down zoomish thing using rf
Zooms too

2/26/2012
Reorganized code and updated makefile

Introduced God
-serves as a driver

main.cpp
-integrated God
-removed a lot of unnessecary code

2/21/2013
Agent
-now moves

Camera
-can now follow a target
-ray picking now behaves appropriately
-cleaned up code

2/15/2013
Camera:
Added fetch functions, getTar, getLoc

2/13/2013
main.cpp:
started implementing embedded controls
'const bool gameOver' changed to 'bool gameOver'
-variable is not meant as const
window now closes when exit button is pressed

2/12/2013  :  ~340
Object:
Added virtual void draw() const
-draws a small red box

Vector:
Overloaded '=='
Overloaded '='

Agent:
Added virtual void move()

2/11/2013  :  300
Made a makefile
App now quits when 'q' is pressed
Camera now available
Checkered floor now available

2/5/2013
Following classes created:
-Floor
-Object
-Vector
-WinMgr

Wrote a main, mostly for testing

A drawing class was started, does not compile
